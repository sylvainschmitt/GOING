We kept only pair-end reads without adaptors and a phred score above 15 in a sliding window of 4. Seventy percent of trimmed reads mapped off-targets using bwa (Li &amp; Durbin 2009). We thus mapped trimmed reads on the hybrid reference built for the sequence capture experiment using bwa (Li &amp; Durbin 2009), picard (Broad Institute 2018), samtools (Li et al. 2009) and bedtools (Quinlan &amp; Hall 2010). We called variants for each individual using HaplotypeCaller, aggregated variants using GenomicsDBImport and jointly-genotyped individuals using GenotypeGVCFs all in GATK4 software (Auwera et al. 2013). We filtered biallelic SNPs with a quality above 30, a quality by depth above 2, a Fisher strand bias below 60 and strand odds ratio above 3 using GATK4 (Auwera et al. 2013). Finally, we filtered individuals and SNPs for missing data with a maximum of 95% and 15% of missing data per individual and SNP, respectively, using plink2 (Chen et al. 2019). We obtained 454,262 biallelic SNPs over 385 individuals without outgroups, that we used for population genetic analyses. Since low-frequency alleles and linkage disequilibrium will bias the number of fixed loci and increase the number of false-positives in genomic scans for outliers (Foll &amp; Gaggiotti 2008), we built a second dataset for quantitative genomics and genomic scans, filtering variants with a minor allele frequency above 5% (18 individuals) and with linkage disequilibrium \\(r^2&lt;0.99\\). We further removed admixed individuals (see population genetic analyses for criteria) and retained 70,737 biallelic SNPs over 372 individuals. 4.1 Quality Check We received demultiplexed libraries from sequencing. We check edsequences quality combining already produced fastqc and compare them with originally furnished (i) baits, (ii) targets, and (iii) references: Multi Quality Check: we used multiqc to combined fastqc inputs for every library (1002 for forward and reverse individuals) and check sequences, counts, quality and GC content Trimming: we trimmed sequences removing bad quality and adaptors sequences Targets mapping: we mapped 10 libraries on targets to check of-targets sequences Reference mapping: we mapped 10 libraries on hybrid reference to check of-reference sequences, and assess de novo usefulness 4.1.1 Multi Quality Check We used multiqc to combined fastqc inputs for every library (1002 for forward and reverse individuals) and check sequences, counts, quality and GC content. cd ~/Documents/BIOGECO/PhD/data/Eschweilera_Paracou/Sequences/quality multiqc fastqc mkdir multiqc mv multiqc_data/ multiqc_report.html L1.fastqc.tar.gz L2.fastqc.tar.gz multiqc 4.1.1.1 Counts We had a big heterogeneity of sample representativity (215 000 folds), but 85% of samples had more than 66 6667 sequences (ca 1M targets / 150 bp * 10X). Moreover duplicated sequences were obviously more present in over-representated individuals, probably more linked to PCR biased than sequencing issues. Figure 4.1: Sequence counts. 4.1.1.2 Quality Sequences quality was very good as the Phred score is above 25 for every bases on all positions across all sequences. Figure 4.2: Phred score. 4.1.1.3 GC content The mean GC content was 41.5 and only few sequences had non expected global content or content across the sequence. Figure 4.3: GC content across sequences. Figure 4.4: GC content within sequences. 4.1.2 Trimming We listed all libraries in a text files and trimmed all libraries with trimmomatic in pair end (PE) into paired and unpaired compressed fastq files (fq.gz). We trimmed the adaptor (ILLUMINACLIP) of our protocol (TruSeq3-PE) with a seed mismatches of 2 (mismatched count allowed), a threshold for clipping palindrome of 30 (authorized match for ligated adapters), a threshold for simple clip of 10 (match between adapter and sequence), a minimum adaptor length of 2, and keeping both reads each time (keepBothReads). We trimmed sequences on phred score with a minimum of 15 in sliding window of 4 (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15) without trimming the beginning (LEADING:X) or the end (TRAILING:X). Without surprise due to the high quality check of sequencing, trimming resulted in 99.91% of paired trimmed reads compared to raw reads (4.5). Thus the main issue of our dataset &lt;as more the representativity of sequences more than their quality. data.frame(libraries = list.files(file.path(path, &quot;Sequences&quot;, &quot;raw&quot;))) %&gt;% mutate(libraries = gsub(&quot;_R[12].fastq.gz&quot;, &quot;&quot;, libraries)) %&gt;% unique() %&gt;% write_tsv(path = file.path(path, &quot;Sequences&quot;, &quot;libraries.txt&quot;), col_names = F) read_tsv(file.path(path, &quot;Sequences&quot;, &quot;libraries.txt&quot;), col_names = &quot;Library&quot;) %&gt;% sample_n(10) %&gt;% write_tsv(path = file.path(path, &quot;Sequences&quot;, &quot;libraries_mapping.txt&quot;), col_names = F) #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --time=36:00:00 #SBATCH -J trimming #SBATCH -o trimming_output.out #SBATCH -e trimming_error.out #SBATCH --mem=20G #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL module load bioinfo/Trimmomatic-0.36 for library in $(cat libraries.txt) do java -jar $TRIM_HOME/trimmomatic.jar PE \\ raw/&quot;$library&quot;_R1.fastq.gz raw/&quot;$library&quot;_R2.fastq.gz \\ trimmed/paired/&quot;$library&quot;_R1_paired.fq.gz trimmed/unpaired/&quot;$library&quot;_R1_unpaired.fq.gz \\ trimmed/paired/&quot;$library&quot;_R2_paired.fq.gz trimmed/unpaired/&quot;$library&quot;_R2_unpaired.fq.gz \\ ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads \\ SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 done cat trimmed/paired_stat.txt for file in $(ls trimmed/paired) do zcat trimmed/paired/$file | echo $file&quot; &quot;$((`wc -l`/4)) &gt;&gt; trimmed/paired_stat.txt done cat trimmed/unpaired_stat.txt for file in $(ls trimmed/unpaired) do zcat trimmed/unpaired/$file | echo $file&quot; &quot;$((`wc -l`/4)) &gt;&gt; trimmed/unpaired_stat.txt done Figure 4.5: Trimming results. 4.1.3 Targets mapping We mapped 10 libraries on targets to check of-targets sequences and targets loss.

For that we used the following pipeline: Variant calling Run the HaplotypeCaller on each sample’s BAM files to create single-sample gVCFs using the .g.vcf extension for the output file. Data aggregation Aggregate the GVCF files and feed in one GVCF with GenomicsDBImport to be genotyped Joint genotyping Run GenotypeGVCFs on all of them together to create the raw SNP and indel VCFs that are usually emitted by the callers. 4.3.1 Variant calling Run the HaplotypeCaller on each sample’s BAM files to create single-sample gVCFs using the .g.vcf extension for the output file. We used sarray which is much powerful than sbatch in parallel computing. # folders mkdir variantCalling/gvcf5 # test file=$(ls mapping/bam5/*.bam | head -n 1) srun --mem=20G --pty bash module load bioinfo/gatk-4.1.2.0 ; gatk --java-options &quot;-Xmx20G&quot; HaplotypeCaller -R reference/reference.fasta -I $file -O variantCalling/gvcf4/$(basename &quot;${file%.*}&quot;).g.vcf.gz -ERC GVCF exit rm variantCalling/gvcf4/* # sarray for file in $(ls mapping/bam5/*.bam); do echo &quot;module load bioinfo/gatk-4.1.2.0 ; gatk --java-options \\&quot;-Xmx20G\\&quot; HaplotypeCaller -R reference/reference.fasta -I $file -O variantCalling/gvcf5/$(basename &quot;${file%.*}&quot;).g.vcf.gz -ERC GVCF&quot;; done &gt; haplo5.sh mkdir haplo5 sarray -J haplo5 -o haplo5/%j.out -e haplo5/%j.err -t 48:00:00 --mem=20G --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL haplo5.sh # clean rm -r haplo5 rm -r tmp 4.3.2 Data aggregation We aggregated the GVCF files and feed in one GVCF database with GenomicsDBImport to be genotyped. Beware, GATK 4.0.0.0 does not deal with multiple intervals when using GenomicsDBImport, so we used GATK 4.1.2.0. We divided the step on several intervals files of a maximum of 1000 sequences computed in parallel to speed up the operation. NB, we tested the pipeline with 3 individual haplotypes and 10 intervals of 100 sequences ran in parallel; and it took 24 minutes. Consequently with 10 fold more sequences per intervals we may increase to 4H, and the effect of 10 fold more individual haplotypes is hard to assess. Due to a memory overload on the cluster I boosted the sarray to 24G per node beside limiting gatk java session to 20G, still the overload is strange as if gatk was opening parallel session of 20G java. We should not decrease batch size as batch of 50 individuals means that we will use 9 batches ! If memory issues persist we may decrease the intervals length (currently 1000 sequences) and increase the number of jobs in sarray. We may even decrease intervals to 100 sequences resulting in more than 800 jobs and run them by batch of 100 hundreds if they are really more efficient. Running a first batch of 10 samples on 100 sequences took 35 minutes. Thus 432 samples should took ca 1 day and 40 minutes. This is the first run of DB among 8, so in total DB built should take 8 days ! But on the other hand joint genotyping might be launch on each run as soon as they finish. So we might clean the first vcf and obtained a preview of population genetics structure with the first 100 sequences. # Sample map touch sample_map.txt for file in $(ls gvcf*/*.g.vcf.gz) do echo -e $(basename &quot;${file%.*}&quot;)&quot;\\t&quot;$file &gt;&gt; sample_map.txt done # seq lists mkdir reference.sequences.lists cut ../reference/reference.fasta.fai -f1 &gt; reference.sequences.lists/reference.sequences.list cd reference.sequences.lists split -l 100 -d reference.sequences.list reference.sequences_ --additional-suffix=.list rm reference.sequences.list ls | wc -l cd .. # folders mkdir tmp mkdir symcaptureDB # test srun --mem=24G --pty bash file=$(ls reference.sequences.lists/ | head -n 1) module load bioinfo/gatk-4.1.2.0 ; gatk --java-options &quot;-Xmx20g -Xms20g&quot; GenomicsDBImport --genomicsdb-workspace-path symcaptureDB/&quot;${file%.*}&quot;.DB -L reference.sequences.lists/$file --sample-name-map sample_map.txt --batch-size 50 --tmp-dir=tmp exit rm -r symcaptureDB/* rm tmp/* # sarray for file in $(ls reference.sequences.lists/); do echo &quot;module load bioinfo/gatk-4.1.2.0 ; gatk --java-options \\&quot;-Xmx20g -Xms20g\\&quot; GenomicsDBImport --genomicsdb-workspace-path symcaptureDB/\\&quot;${file%.*}\\&quot;.DB -L reference.sequences.lists/$file --sample-name-map sample_map.txt --batch-size 10 --consolidate&quot;; done &gt; combine.sh split -l 207 -d combine.sh combine_ --additional-suffix=.sh rm combine.sh mkdir combine sarray -J combine -o combine/%j.out -e combine/%j.err -t 48:00:00 --mem=40G --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL combine.sh rm combine_00.sh rm -r combine rm -r tmp # clean rm -r combine rm -r tmp 4.3.3 Joint genotyping We joint-genotyped individuals with GenotypeGVCFs on all of them together to create the raw SNP and indel VCFs that are usually emitted by the callers. We divided the step on several intervals files of a maximum of 1000 sequences computed in parallel to speed up the operation (similarly to previous step). NB, we tested the pipeline with 3 individual haplotypes and 10 intervals of 100 sequences ran in parallel; and it took 6 minutes. Consequently with 10 fold more sequences per intervals we may increase to 1H, and the effect of 10 fold more individual haplotypes is hard to assess.

Ideally, we wanted to keep all individuals, but this would result in a lot of SNP loss because of least represented individuals. So we needed to chose a threshold for missing data for individuals --mind and SNPs --geno. module load bioinfo/plink_high_contig_20190905 module load bioinfo/plink2_high_contig_20190905 mkdir filtered plink2 --threads 8 --memory 80000 \\ --vcf symcapture.all.biallelic.snp.filtered.vcf.gz \\ --allow-extra-chr \\ --make-bed --out filtered/symcapture.all.biallelic.snp.filtered cd filtered plink --threads 8 --memory 80000 \\ --bfile symcapture.all.biallelic.snp.filtered \\ --allow-extra-chr --missing --het --freq --pca --freqx \\ --out symcapture.all.biallelic.snp.filtered Figure 4.11: Missing data statistics for filtered biallelic SNP before missing data filtering per individual.
