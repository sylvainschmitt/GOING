# Genetic species delimitation

We investigated population genetic structure using `admixture` [@Alexander2011], 
using 10 repetitions of K genetic groups varying from 1 to 10 and assessed the number of gene pools with cross validation.
We defined individuals with a membership to gene pools below 90% as admixed and the remaining individuals as genetically pure.
We further investigated admixture with the `introgress` R package [@Gompert2010], 
using genetically pure individuals as parental populations and all individuals as the hybrid population.
We validated gene pool delimitation by comparison with botanical identifications using a confusion matrix, 
and we conducted a second blind-identification of every collected individual in November 2019.
